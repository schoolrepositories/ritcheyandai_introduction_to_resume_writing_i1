<h2>What is a Resume?</h2>
<p>A <strong>resume</strong> is a <strong>summary</strong> of a person's skills, experience, and education that is used to apply for jobs. Employers use resumes to quickly assess whether a candidate is a good fit for a position. A well-structured resume should be clear, concise, and optimized for both human readers and <strong>Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)</strong>.</p>

<h2>Common Resume Sections</h2>
<p>A resume is typically divided into several sections:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Contact Information:</strong> Includes name, phone number, email, and sometimes a LinkedIn profile.</li>
    <li><strong>Summary:</strong> A brief paragraph that highlights key experience, skills, and career goals.</li>
    <li><strong>Work History:</strong> Lists past job experiences in <strong>chronological</strong> order, starting with the most recent.</li>
    <li><strong>Education:</strong> Details degrees, certifications, and relevant coursework.</li>
    <li><strong>Skills:</strong> Highlights key technical and soft skills relevant to the job.</li>
    <li><strong>Certifications (Optional):</strong> Demonstrates specialized training and expertise.</li>
    <li><strong>Additional Sections (Optional):</strong> Can include volunteer work, professional affiliations, or personal projects.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Understanding ATS</h2>
<p>Many employers use <strong>Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)</strong> to manage job applications. ATS software <strong>scans</strong> resumes to identify keywords and qualifications that match the job description. To improve the chances of passing an ATS scan, resumes should:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Use <strong>simple, clear formatting</strong></li>
    <li>Avoid <strong>images</strong> or complex designs</li>
    <li>Use <strong>standard headings</strong> (e.g., "Work History")</li>
    <li>Include <strong>relevant</strong> keywords from the job posting</li>
</ul>

<h2>Resume Formats</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Chronological Resume:</strong> Best for candidates with a strong work history.</li>
    <li><strong>Functional Resume:</strong> Best for career changers or those with gaps in employment.</li>
    <li><strong>Combination Resume:</strong> Mixes elements of both chronological and functional formats.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Common Resume File Types</h2>
<p>Employers often require resumes to be submitted in specific file formats:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>PDF:</strong> Preserves formatting and is widely accepted, but some ATS software may have trouble reading it.</li>
    <li><strong>DOCX:</strong> A Word document that is ATS-friendly and easy to edit.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Final Tips</h2>
<ul>
    <li>A strong resume should be <strong>one</strong> page long for most applicants.</li>
    <li>It should be tailored to match the job description.</li>
    <li>Use <strong>action-oriented</strong> language.</li>
    <li>Check for <strong>typos</strong> before submitting.</li>
    <li>Use <strong>bullet points</strong> to improve <strong>readability</strong>.</li>
    <li>Avoid including <strong>personal information</strong> such as age, marital status, or a photo unless required.</li>
</ul>
