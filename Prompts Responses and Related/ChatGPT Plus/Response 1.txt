**An Introduction to Resume Writing**  

A **resume** is a **summary** of a person's skills, experience, and education that is used to apply for jobs. Employers use resumes to quickly assess whether a candidate is a good fit for a position. A well-structured resume should be clear, concise, and optimized for both human readers and **Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)**.

### Common Resume Sections  

A resume is typically divided into several sections:

1. **Contact Information**  
   - This section is at the top of the resume and includes the applicant’s name, phone number, email address, and sometimes a LinkedIn profile.  

2. **Summary**  
   - This is a brief paragraph that provides an overview of the applicant’s experience, skills, and career goals. It serves as an introduction to the rest of the resume.  

3. **Work History**  
   - This section lists past job experiences in **chronological** order, starting with the most recent. Each job entry should include the company name, job title, dates of employment, and a list of responsibilities or achievements.  

4. **Education**  
   - This section highlights degrees, certifications, or relevant coursework. It is particularly important for recent graduates or positions that require specific educational credentials.  

5. **Skills**  
   - This section showcases key technical and soft skills relevant to the job. For example, an IT professional might list programming languages, while a customer service representative might list communication skills.  

6. **Certifications** (Optional)  
   - Certifications can add credibility to a resume and show that the applicant has specialized training in their field.  

7. **Additional Sections** (Optional)  
   - Some resumes may include sections like volunteer work, professional affiliations, or personal projects.  

### Understanding ATS  

Many employers use **Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)** to manage job applications. ATS software **scans** resumes to identify keywords and qualifications that match the job description. To improve the chances of passing an ATS scan, resumes should:  

- Use **simple, clear formatting**  
- Avoid **images** or complex designs  
- Use **standard headings** (e.g., "Work History" instead of "Experience Timeline")  
- Include **relevant** keywords from the job posting  

### Resume Formats  

There are three main resume formats:  

1. **Chronological Resume**  
   - Best for candidates with a strong work history.  
   - Lists jobs in order from most recent to oldest.  

2. **Functional Resume**  
   - Best for career changers or those with gaps in employment.  
   - Focuses on skills rather than job history.  

3. **Combination Resume**  
   - Mixes elements of both chronological and functional formats.  
   - Highlights skills while also providing a work history.  

### Common Resume File Types  

Employers often require resumes to be submitted in specific file formats to ensure compatibility. The most common resume file types are:  

- **PDF**: Preserves formatting and is widely accepted, but some older ATS software may have difficulty reading it.  
- **DOCX**: A Word document that is ATS-friendly and easy to edit.  

It’s generally recommended to submit a **PDF** resume unless the job application specifically requests a **DOCX** file.  

### Final Tips  

A strong resume should be **one** page long for most applicants. It should be tailored to match the job description, use **action-oriented** language, and be free from **typos**. Including **certifications** can improve credibility, while **bullet points** enhance **readability**.  

Avoid including **personal information** such as age, marital status, or a photo unless specifically required. Before submitting a resume, always proofread it carefully to ensure accuracy.
